Security-Gated CI/CD Pipeline (GitHub → CodePipeline → ECR → ECS)
Automated deployment pipeline with three security gates:

Gate A: ECR vulnerability scanning (blocks CRITICAL CVEs)
Gate B: Custom IAM wildcard detection (prevents Action:/Resource: except allowlisted policies)
Gate C: AWS Access Analyzer policy validation (catches syntax errors, security warnings)

Currently developing Gate D and a reporting tool. Will provide full Readme upon completion
